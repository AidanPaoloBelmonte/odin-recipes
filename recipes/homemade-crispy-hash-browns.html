        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Medium Russet Potatoes (Shredded)</li>
            <li>1/2 Medium Onion (Finely Chopped)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1 Cup Oil (For frying, or as needed)</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper (To taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour and egg until evenly distributed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat around 1/4 inch oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is sizzling hot, place the potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 thick layer, either covering the entire pan, or in small piles (similar to pancakes).
            </li>
            <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side, each side taking around 5 minutes to brown. </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Season with Salt and Pepper then serve immediately. Serve hot and enjoy!
